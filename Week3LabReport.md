## Part One

**Code**

`import java.io.IOException;`

`import java.net.URI;`

`import java.util.ArrayList;`

`class Handler implements URLHandler {`

    ArrayList<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>();

- The method handleRequest(URI url) is called. The relevant arguments are either nothing after the 4000 or "/". If these values are found in the url, then once the request is processed it will show a server that displays "Stringlist:"

> Adding strings to server

- The method handleRequest(URI url) is called. The relevant arguments are "/add". If these values are found in the url, the string found after the query will be added to a string list. Then the server will display "Has been added to Stringlist: *string added*"

> Displaying updated Stringlist

- The method handleRequest(URI url) is called. The relevant arguments are "/Stringlist". If these values are found in the url, then it will return a string format of the stringlist. The server will display "Stringlist is now: *list of strings*"

## Part Two
 > Bug 1

 **ArrayExamples - reverseInPlace**

![Image](bug1input.png)
 - The failure-inducing input was {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

![Image](bug1output.png)
 - The sympton was at index 3 it expected a value 2 and not a 4

 - The bug was it's not reversing the list. So in order to fix it, I did the following. 
 
 *Original vs New*

 ![Image](bug1original.png)
 ![Image](bug1fixed.png)

 - One can see that the original code wasn't switching the first elements to the end, instead the for loop was moving the last elements to the front. In the fixed code, a temp value was created to save the element being reversed. Also it took into consideration arrays that were odd or even in index by diving the length of the for loop by 2.
 
 - Ultimately the bug caused that particular sympton because it was not saving the value of the element that was going to be reversed.

 > Bug 2

**ListExamples - filter**

- The failure-inducing input was the following

 ![Image](bug2input.png)

 - The Sympton were compile errors because the checkString method had not been implemented in ListExamples. 

 - The bug was fixed by first of all making sure that ListExamples implemented the interface StringChecker and adding the implementation of the method checkString(String s) 



-The failure-inducing input (the code of the test)
-The symptom (the failing test output)
-The bug (the code fix needed)
-Then, explain the connection between the symptom and the bug. Why does the bug cause that particular symptom for that particular input?
